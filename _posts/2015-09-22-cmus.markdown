The use of online music streaming services has almost eliminated my need for a software music player. But when there are times that I want to play a few of my favorites in a less compromising sound quality than an online music service has to offer, I'll always opt for [cmus][2], a tiny player that will browse through my nearly 300GB digital music collection with ease, handles flac and can be easily configured to do scrobbling.

Installation is not more than a simple `apt-get install cmus` command as it is available in the main repository. It should work out of the box in most cases but for system using [ALSA][3], the default settings will have to be changed to get sound. Press `7` within cmus, find the variables and change them accordingly as below:

```
> dsp.alsa.device		`default`    
> mixer.alsa.channel	`Master`    
> mixer.alsa.device		`default`    
> output_plugin			`alsa`
```

I use [cmusfm][4] for scrobbling. Installation is done by cloning the repo and build it. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arkq/cmusfm.git
```

It may be necessary to change the last line of the instruction to `make && sudo make install` if you are following the README.md in the git repo. Finally, cmus must be told to use cmusfm. This is done by going to the cmus setting tab once more. Press `7`, find and change the following variable:

```
> status_display_program	`cmusfm`    
```
